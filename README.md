# Air-BnB-Project
This beginner project consisted of using a data download from Inside Airbnb to clean and normalize the data.  
Data was retrieved from https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/.
The data was then imported into Tableau Public on my local machine to create an interactive dashboard to be used for business insights.
